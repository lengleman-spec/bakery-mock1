      <h2>About Us</h2>
      <p>
        Brookside Bakery began in Pittsburgh, PA in 2021 with a simple idea:
        share the kind of homemade treats our family has always loved. We’re a
        family-run shop, and everything that comes out of our kitchen is baked
        fresh each day and hand-decorated personally — no shortcuts, no mixes,
        no machines, just real ingredients, busy hands, and a lot of heart.
      </p>

      <p>
        We specialize in decorated cookies and custom cakes for all of life’s
        special occasions. Birthdays, weddings, baby showers, or “just because”
        — we love creating sweets that feel personal and memorable. None of our
        bakers have formal training; every recipe, every design, and every skill
        was learned through family generations. What started as family
        traditions became a small community bakery built on creativity,
        curiosity, and a love for sharing good food. At Brookside Bakery, we
        hope every bite feels like home.

      <p>
        At Brookside Bakery, our mission is to create pastries and custom treats
        that are as fresh, honest, and heartfelt as the family traditions they
        come from. We are committed to using fresh ingredients, baking
        everything 100% homemade, and crafting each cookie and cake with the
        same care we put into our own family table. We strive to bring joy to
        our community through beautifully made, freshly baked sweets that
        celebrate life’s special moments.
